"**Grammar Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**\n* \"I wants to books a room two nights.\"\n* Correction: \"I want to book a room for two nights.\"\n* Note: \"The subject 'I' requires the correct modal verb 'want,' and 'books' should be the base form 'book,' and 'two nights' should be preceded by 'for' for grammatical agreement.\"\n\n2. **Verb Tense**\n* \"May I know the number of guests staying?\"\n* Correction: \"May I know the number of guests who will be staying?\"\n* Note: \"The verb tense 'will be staying' is more suitable to describe the future action than the simple present 'staying'.\"\n\n3. **missing Article**\n* \"No smoking with a city view, if possible.\"\n* Correction: \"Non-smoking with a city view, if possible.\"\n* Note: \"The article 'non-smoking' is missing, and the phrase can be written in a more precise way.\"\n\n4. **Comma Splice**\n* \"That's perfect. Thanks your help!\"\n* Correction: \"That's perfect. Thank you for your help!\"\n* Note: \"The sentence lacks a verb and the verb 'is' is missing after 'perfect,' and the phrase 'thanks your help' requires a comma between the verb 'thank' and the prepositional phrase 'for your help'.\"\n\n5. **Pronoun Error**\n* \"Thanks your help!\"\n* Correction: \"Thank you for your help!\"\n* Note: \"The verb 'thanks' is incorrect, and the correct phrase is 'thank you,' and the correct possessive form is 'your' instead of 'your.'\""
